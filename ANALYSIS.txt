I will log my analysis notes here.

Of my main batch of cards, only 6 of 63 have NO DATA beyond sector zero, block zero. In other words, sector zero blocks 1 and 2, and sectors 1 through 15, are all zeroes -- unused.

Of my DEFCON batch, 10 of 13 (>75%) have no data beyond sector zero, block zero.  

What's the pattern here?

Initial thoughts: Since sector zero block zero is normally unwritable, perhaps the Vegas hotels are security-forward, using NOTHING in the writable zones for authentication. So that scammers armed with a Proxmark can't easily wreak havoc on their systems. However, this must be tempered by the knowledge that I picked up some of these cards on eBay after the con; i.e., they might have been sold by a rogue hotel employee and never have actually been issued, which could explain the lack of data.

It's possible that the six non-DEFCON cards I have are also from Vegas hotels. Without more information, that's hard to tell.

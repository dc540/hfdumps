Dumps from a collection of hotel room keys for analysis

This is a collection of dumps of HF RFID hotel keys collected over several years.

Dumps were made from the autopwn feature of iceman's proxmark3 firmware on a
Proxmark3 RDV4 using the stock antenna.

The majority of them are Mifare keys, with a smattering of others thrown in for good measure.

Probably a good representative cross-section of what's out there in the real world.

Maybe a good source for a key dictionary to speed up pwns?

Feedback welcome.

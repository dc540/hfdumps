Dumps from a collection of hotel room keys for analysis

This is a collection of dumps of HF RFID hotel keys collected over several years.

Dumps of Mifare cards were made from the "hf mf autopwn" command of iceman's proxmark3 
firmware on a Proxmark3 RDV4 using the stock antenna.

The majority of them are Mifare keys, with a smattering of others thrown in for good measure.

Probably a good representative cross-section of what's out there in the real world.

Maybe a good source for a key dictionary to speed up pwns?

There are three types of files.  .bin, .eml and .json.  Keys discovered are greppable in the
.json files.  Might post an analysis at some point.

Feedback welcome.
